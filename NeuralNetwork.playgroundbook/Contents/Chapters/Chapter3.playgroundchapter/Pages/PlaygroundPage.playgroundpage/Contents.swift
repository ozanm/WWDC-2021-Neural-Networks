 # Congratulations üëèüéâüéà
 Take a moment and celebrate yourself!

 You've finished the book and learned [how to add layers to a network](Hello%20World/XOR), [how to use activation functions and other parameters](Creating%20Networks/Epochs,%20Learning%20Rate%20and%20Activation%20Functions), [leaned about the importance of preprocessing](Creating%20Networks/Data%20&%20Preprocessing) and [played around with your own your Network](Creating%20Networks/Playground).

 # What's next
 There is still a lot to discover on top of your new gained knowledge.

 ## Ethics and Privacy
 Whenever you work with data, you should make sure that it is collected in an ethically correct way. If the data originates from people or their interactions, they should be informed about its use and asked for consent.

 ## CreateML & CoreML
 Apple's platforms offer a lot of tools to efficiently execute or train machine learning models such as CoreML or CreateML.

 ## Convolution Neural Networks
 Especially for data with many input dimensions, such as images, Convolutional Neural Networks achieve significantly better results. Especially for data with many input dimensions, such as images, Convolutional Neural Networks achieve significantly better results. They use convolutions between the layers. Check out my  [Playground](https://github.com/lennet/image-filtering) about Image Filtering with Convolutions if you want to learn more.
