# WWDC-2021-Neural-Networks
Here we once again this year. Yep I decided to take another wack at submitting a playground that teaches the user about Neural Networks. This time however, it came with a twist! My mom just got a new iPad I figured to make a Playground Book this time. Let's see if it does the trick.

# Update
WE WON! ðŸŽ‰ After 4 years of trying it out! Not really a flex, but I guess it's cool.
